## Registration of iGetter
This trial version allows you to evaluate iGetter. There is no time or features limit, but if iGetter suits your needs, you should consider purchasing it. iGetter will show a reminder dialog at every startup during the evaluation.
To purchase iGetter, select "Register" function in the Help menu. Then, click on the "Purchase" button and follow the instructions on our WebStore.

## Antivirus reports
iGetter is clean from viruses, so if some antivirus software reports a threat, you may be confident that it’s a false positive. This package is published by the software vendor itself and includes the official release of iGetter.

Currently, Cynet is the only antivirus engine that flags our product on VirusTotal. We contacted Cynet about this false positive and they corrected their engine. But after a month, Cynet again wrongly flagged the same file. The main executable iGetter.exe is all green with all antivirus engines including Cynet. The flagged file is named iGetter_x86.exe, which is a Native messaging host required for iGetter browser extension in Chromium based browsers.

Here are some other antivirus reports which found iGetter as `100% clean`. Softpedia and Download3k have downloaded and tested version 3.0.0 of iGetter using several antivirus engines. They have found it to be clean of any form of badware (viruses, spyware, adware, etc.). You can view the scan reports of [Download3k](https://www.download3k.com/Antivirus-Report-iGetter.html "Clean - Full Antivirus Test") and [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Download-Managers/iGetter.shtml#status "100% Clean Download").</description>
